# hello-kubernetes

This is a code challenge to deploy a 'hello, world' web server into a Kubernetes cluster using the following technologies:

1. Kubernetes + Helm

2. An ingress controller configured with the LoadBalancer type

3. A web server that just serves up the text 'Hello, world!"

4. A runbook describing how to administer the basic server

5. Plans for expansion of the project and improving security and reliability. What is the biggest vulnerability here and what would you do with 40 more hours?
